Below is the project framework for the "System Design Dashboard" built with ReactJS and TailwindCSS, using an in-memory database to manage system design data. This framework includes a detailed project structure, instructions for using Copilot, and feature markdown files for each section of the system design framework. The dashboard will collect use-case parameters (e.g., number of users, QPS, data size) and generate a complete end-to-end system design.

# System Design Dashboard Project Framework

This document outlines the project framework for the "System Design Dashboard," a ReactJS and TailwindCSS-based application with an in-memory database. The dashboard collects basic use-case information (e.g., Netflix, Twitter, Uber) such as the number of users, queries per second (QPS), and data size, and generates a comprehensive system design following a structured framework.

### System Design Dashboard

A ReactJS-based dashboard styled with TailwindCSS that generates end-to-end system designs from user inputs like number of users, QPS, and data size. It uses an in-memory database for data management.

#### Purpose
- Enable users to input use-case parameters.
- Output a structured system design covering all critical aspects.

#### Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npm start`

See [getting-started.md](./docs/getting-started.md) for detailed instructions.

#### Using Copilot
Refer to [copilot-instructions.md](./docs/copilot-instructions.md) for leveraging Copilot in development.

## docs/copilot-instructions.md

### Using Copilot for System Design Dashboard

GitHub Copilot can accelerate development by generating code, documentation, and design suggestions. Below are guidelines and prompts to maximize its utility.

#### Guidelines
- Use specific prompts tied to feature requirements.
- Cross-check generated code against the system design framework.
- Combine Copilot suggestions with the provided templates.

#### Example Prompts
- "Create a React component to input and display QPS and user count."
- "Generate an ASCII diagram for a high-level architecture of a ride-sharing app."
- "Suggest an in-memory database schema for storing system design metadata."

See the `features/` directory for detailed requirements to guide your prompts.
