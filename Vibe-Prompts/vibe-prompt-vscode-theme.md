You are an expert in designing high-quality Visual Studio Code themes.

🎨 Goal: Generate a complete, production-ready VS Code theme named “DarkGrey Blueprint”, inspired by the aesthetics of the “Dark Modern” theme.

🔧 Requirements:
• Color scheme: Minimalist, Dark Grey Base (not black or blue)
• Low-contrast background with subtle variations
• Legible but elegant syntax highlighting (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS)
• Well-balanced color palette for both dark mode comfort and visual clarity
• Minimalistic UI with clean separation of editor, sidebar, status bar, etc.

💡 Design Inspiration:
– VS Code’s “Dark Modern”
– macOS Terminal Midnight theme
– GitHub Dark Dimmed

🧩 Deliverables:
• package.json with metadata
• themes/DarkGrey-blueprint-color-theme.json defining token colors and UI colors
• Support for light/dark icon themes
• Publisher-ready format

🧪 Validate it with TypeScript and React code samples.

✅ Final output should be directly usable in a VS Code extension folder.
