# System Design Dashboard - Complete Development Prompt

## üéØ Project Overview
Build a comprehensive **System Design Dashboard** that generates professional system architecture designs based on user inputs. The application should serve both learning and professional use cases, providing detailed system designs with visual diagrams and comprehensive documentation.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Features & Requirements

### 1. Input Methods
Create two primary input pathways:

**Free Form Input:**
- Natural language description of the system
- Single-line system goals or definitions
- Conversational interface for requirements gathering

**Structured Intake Form:**
- Daily Active Users (DAU) & Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Queries Per Second (QPS) estimates
- Data size estimates (storage requirements)
- Traffic patterns (burst, steady, seasonal)
- Read/Write ratio percentages
- Geographic distribution (global, regional, local)
- Peak traffic multiplier factors
- Consistency requirements (eventual vs strong)
- Latency requirements (real-time, near-real-time, batch)
- Availability targets (99.9%, 99.99%, 99.999%)
- Budget constraints
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Technology preferences/constraints

### 2. System Library
Pre-populate with popular system designs:
- **Social Media:** Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok
- **Streaming:** Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, Twitch
- **E-commerce:** Amazon, eBay, Shopify
- **Transportation:** Uber, Lyft, DoorDash
- **Travel:** Airbnb, Booking.com

### 3. AI-Powered Generation Engine
Implement dual generation approaches:

**Rule-Based Engine:**
- Predefined decision trees based on scale, requirements
- Template-based architecture patterns
- Component selection based on input parameters
- Cost optimization algorithms

**LLM Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude integration for creative system design
- Prompt engineering for consistent output format
- Fallback to rule engine if LLM unavailable
- Hybrid approach combining both methods
